While following the directions to get [jekyll up and running on Windows 10 ](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) I installed Ubuntu for Windows and I have to say I am pretty impressed with the result. It took about an hour or so to following all of the instructions but atter that I can us all of the Linux commands I want but using `bash <command>` for example to list the files I can type this into the command line `bash ls -ila`.
